# A simple discord bot written in haskell

As an experiment I wanted to start learning Haskell programming language.
What makes this language special is its syntax and purity.
Haskell is high level, completely functional programming language, which compiles into machine code, making it really fast.

### Details
- Uses Calamity as the core
- Done purely for educational purposes
- Code is most likely dirty and inefficient
- No real world use
- Use at your own risk
